For Statistical Machine Learning Record at Rice U. The mathematical proof and personal understanding of the algorithms I learned will also added from time to time.

I am trying to figure out why the algorithms are useful and what makes them reasonable from mathematical perspective. What are simplified from theory to practice, and the condition they can work well.
